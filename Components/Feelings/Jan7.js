            <p>
                Hey there!

                <br></br>
                
                I don't know what is happening to me at this moment, whatever it is, I'm just super sad whenever I think about 
                *person who shall remain unnamed* I'll call that person Node. Ever since I expressed my feelings for Node to them, 
                I've just been feeling kinda shitty. Its not the fact that I got rejected, but rather everything else that 
                followed that event. 

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                
                I don't know what I was thinking when I said that we shouldn't be friends anymore, looking back at that statement, 
                it was probably, by far, the worst mistake of my life. I miss Node a lot as a friend. As a person with barely any  
                friends to begin with, I've never felt lonelier in my life. I really, really regret saying that to them. I was always 
                there for Node if they needed my help for homework or for data structures, keeping review sessions, helping them out 
                at 2 am, and now I feel like all of that effort was for nothing. I feel like I really let them down. 

                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                I really tried to explain her about my personal situation at the time I said those things to them and how I didn't 
                really mean to say those things to them, but I can't really take back those words. I've been trying to reach out
                to them, but I guess they don't want to talk to me anymore, which I totally get, but it is still sad to 
                think about it. Tisza Istivan said it right "I didn't win anything, but I lost everything".

                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                I am at a crossroads, on one hand I could spend the rest of my time at Case, graduate and 
                then leave, on the other I could transfer out. Before this moment, the only thing holding me back from 
                transfering out were my friends, but now I'm all alone here so I don't really have much to lose. The only 
                thing holding me back, is the fact that I know the professors at Case better than wherever I transfer to. Hopefully, 
                I decide and make a conclusion soon. 

                <br></br>
                <br></br>

                Other than that, recently, I've just struggled finding any motivation to keep going on with my life. No matter what 
                I do, I just don't feel fulfilled, maybe because I miss my family and friends. What keeps me up at night is that I 
                always try to be there for others if they need my help, but I just feel like when I need help, I have no one for 
                me. Every weekend, I feel shitty for not have anyone to hang out with, and I just really can't find any purpose to 
                live life in such a way, its just to hard to find a group that will take me in.
