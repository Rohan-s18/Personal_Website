# Personal_Website
## Author: Rohan Singh
Github Repository for my personal website. The development was done on **Next.js**, which is a web-development framework that (in a nutshell) carries out the react.js rendering in the backend (server-side react rendering). Using Next.js makes it easier for us to integrate front-end and back-end very easiy as well.
